📊 Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard – Project Description

This project presents an interactive Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize mobile phone sales data effectively. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different brands, mobile models, cities, days, and payment methods, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Transactions, Total Quantity Sold, and Revenue Trends at the top for quick insights. These KPIs allow stakeholders to instantly understand the overall business performance.

Users can interact with the dashboard using multiple filters and slicers, including Month, Brand, Mobile Model, Payment Method, and Day Name. This enables detailed analysis at different levels and helps identify sales patterns and trends.

A geographical map visualization shows total sales by city across India. Cities with higher sales volumes are highlighted, making it easy to identify top-performing and low-performing locations for regional planning.

The daily quantity trend chart helps analyze customer buying behavior throughout the month by showing sales fluctuations on different days. This insight is useful for inventory planning and operational efficiency.

Customer satisfaction is represented through a Customer Ratings chart, which shows rating distribution from 1 to 5 stars. This helps evaluate product quality and customer experience.

The Transactions by Payment Method chart highlights customer payment preferences, with credit card transactions prominently displayed, offering insights into transaction behavior.

A brand-wise sales table compares popular brands such as Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, and OnePlus based on total sales, quantity sold, and number of transactions.

The mobile model sales chart identifies best-selling phone models, while the sales by day name chart highlights revenue performance across weekdays, helping in promotional planning.

Overall, this dashboard demonstrates practical use of Business Intelligence and data visualization techniques to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights. It is ideal for academic projects, portfolio showcases, and real-world sales analysis use cases.
